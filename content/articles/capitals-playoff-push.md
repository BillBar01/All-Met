## The Situation

Washington sits right on the wild card bubble. Not comfortably in, not hopelessly out. The kind of position that makes every game in February and March feel like a playoff game.

### What's Working

The top line is producing. Goaltending has stabilized. The power play is clicking at the right time. When the Caps play their game — physical, fast, structured — they can beat anyone in the East.

### What Needs to Fix

The third period collapses. It's not just bad luck — the team's conditioning and defensive structure fall apart in the final 20 minutes too often. That has to stop, full stop.

### The Trade Deadline Question

Do you buy, sell, or stand pat? The answer depends on the next two weeks. Win 5 of 7 and you're a buyer. Lose 5 of 7 and you start taking calls on pending UFAs.

### Our Call

This team is good enough to make the playoffs and dangerous enough to win a round. But they need to stop beating themselves first.
