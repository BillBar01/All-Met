## It's Almost Time

Spring training is the most optimistic time of the year. Every team is undefeated, every prospect is the next big thing, and every fan base believes this could be the year. For the Nationals, some of that optimism is actually warranted.

### 1. The Fifth Starter Competition

There are four legitimate candidates for the five spot. That's a good problem to have after years of scraping the bottom of the free agent barrel for arms.

### 2. Outfield Configuration

Too many outfielders, not enough spots. Someone's getting sent down, traded, or moved to a super-utility role. The competition should be fierce.

### 3. The Bullpen Overhaul

New arms, new roles, new energy. The relief corps was a disaster last year. The front office addressed it aggressively. Now we see if the new pieces fit.

### 4. Young Infielders

The kids are coming. At least two top prospects will get extended looks this spring. How they handle the big-league environment matters.

### 5. The Manager's Stamp

New year, new expectations. The coaching staff has had a full offseason to install their systems. Spring is where the culture starts to take shape.
