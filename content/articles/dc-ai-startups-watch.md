## Cutting Through the AI Noise

Every startup claims to be an "AI company" now. Most of them are just wrapping an API call in a nice UI and calling it innovation. But a handful of DC-based companies are doing genuinely interesting work.

### What Makes These Different

They're not chasing consumer hype. They're solving specific, painful problems in industries where Washington has a natural advantage: defense, healthcare policy, regulatory compliance, and cybersecurity.

### The List

1. **A defense-tech company** using AI for real-time threat assessment. Not theoretical — deployed and operational.

2. **A healthcare AI firm** that's actually reducing administrative burden on doctors instead of adding to it.

3. **A regulatory compliance startup** that makes sense of federal regulations using natural language processing. If you've ever tried to read the Federal Register, you understand why this matters.

4. **A cybersecurity company** using AI for threat detection that doesn't produce a million false positives.

5. **An education technology company** building adaptive learning tools for underserved school districts in the DMV.

### The Common Thread

All five are founded by people with deep domain expertise. They didn't start as technologists who picked an industry — they started as industry experts who found technology solutions. That's the right order of operations.

### Why DC Wins Here

Proximity to the customer. When your clients are federal agencies, policy organizations, and regulated industries, being in Washington isn't just convenient — it's a competitive moat.
