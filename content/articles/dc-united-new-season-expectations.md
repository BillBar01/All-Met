## Embrace the Underdog

DC United has been irrelevant in MLS for too long. But there's something interesting happening at Audi Field. New signings, a fresh tactical approach, and a fan base that's been waiting for something to believe in.

### The New Signings

The front office went international this offseason, bringing in talent from South America and Europe. These aren't marquee names — they're young, hungry players with something to prove. That's exactly what this club needs.

### Tactical Shift

The new coaching staff is implementing a high-press, possession-based system. It's a stark departure from the defensive bunker ball of recent years. It'll take time to gel, but the early preseason signs are encouraging.

### Fan Expectations

Just be competitive. That's it. DC United fans aren't demanding trophies — they're demanding effort, identity, and a reason to show up on Saturday nights. Give them that, and the rest will follow.

### Prediction

Mid-table finish with some genuine exciting moments. Not a playoff team yet, but a team that's clearly building toward something. And after the last few years, that counts as progress.
