## Let's Be Honest

The Wizards are terrible this season. That's not a hot take — it's a box score. But there's a meaningful distinction between "losing on purpose with a plan" and "losing because you're poorly constructed." So which is it?

### The Case for Intentional Rebuild

The front office has stockpiled draft picks. They've moved veteran contracts for assets. They're playing young guys extended minutes even when it costs them wins. These are textbook rebuilding moves.

### The Case for Dysfunction

The player development has been inconsistent. Last year's lottery pick isn't showing the leap you'd expect. The coaching staff seems to be improvising rather than developing. These are warning signs.

### What Fans Should Demand

Transparency. A rebuild only works if there's a visible plan. Show us the timeline. Show us the benchmarks. Show us the player development wins, even when the scoreboard is ugly.

Capital One Arena deserves better than vague promises about "the future."
