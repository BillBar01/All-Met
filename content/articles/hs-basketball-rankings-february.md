## The Standings Have Shuffled

January was chaos. Upsets, injuries, and breakout performances have completely reshuffled the DMV high school basketball hierarchy. Let's break down where things stand heading into the postseason.

### The Top 5

The top of the rankings is loaded. Three teams have legitimate state championship aspirations, and two more are dangerous enough to ruin someone's bracket. The depth of talent in the DMV this year is remarkable.

### Biggest Risers

Two teams jumped five-plus spots this month. Both feature sophomore-heavy rosters that have figured out how to win close games. The experience they're getting now will pay dividends for years.

### Biggest Fallers

One team that was ranked first in December has dropped to the back of the top 10. Injuries are the main culprit, but the chemistry issues are real too. They need to figure it out fast.

### Players to Watch in the Playoffs

We've got at least four future D1 guards in the DMV this year, plus a big man who's drawing comparisons to players who shouldn't be mentioned for someone who's still in high school. The playoff tournament is going to be must-watch.

### Our Prediction

The championship game will feature two teams from the same conference. Book it.
