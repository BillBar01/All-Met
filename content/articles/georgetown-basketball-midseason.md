## A Pulse in the Hilltop

Georgetown basketball has been a punchline for years. The empty seats at Capital One Arena. The conference losses to teams nobody's heard of. The constant coaching carousel. But something feels different this season.

### What's Changed

The roster has actual depth for the first time in memory. The transfer portal giveth, and this year the Hoyas received. Three portal additions are contributing immediately, and the freshmen are better than advertised.

### The Big East Problem

The Big East is brutal this year. Even with improvement, Georgetown is fighting for a spot in the middle of the pack. But middle of the pack is a massive upgrade from perennial doormat.

### What Fans Should Feel

Cautious optimism. Not the kind where you start printing March Madness shirts, but the kind where you actually watch the games and don't hate yourself afterward. That's progress.

### The Patrick Ewing Shadow

Georgetown basketball will always be measured against its legendary past. That's unfair but real. The current team can't replicate 1984. What they can do is make the program relevant again. And they're closer to that than they've been in a long time.
