## The Needs Are Clear

Let's not overthink this. The Commanders need help in the secondary, they need edge pressure, and they could use another weapon in the passing game. The good news? This draft class is deep in all three areas.

### Round 1: Best Player Available (But Please, Defense)

The front office has earned some trust by not reaching in recent drafts. Keep that energy. If a premium defensive talent falls, take him. If the board breaks weird, trade back and stockpile picks.

### Day 2: Where Championships Are Built

This is where the real roster building happens. The mid-round corners and edge rushers in this class could start immediately. Washington's scouting staff has hit on Day 2 picks consistently — let them cook.

### The Bottom Line

This roster is closer than people think. A strong draft doesn't mean flashy — it means filling the holes that showed up in January. Do that, and this team is a real problem in the NFC East.
