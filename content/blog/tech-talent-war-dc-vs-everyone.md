## The New Landscape

The days of tech talent being concentrated in San Francisco are over. Remote work blew up the geographic monopoly, and now every city with decent WiFi is competing for the same engineers, designers, and product managers.

### DC's Advantages

Cost of living is lower than SF (barely). The clearance pipeline creates a captive workforce for defense and intelligence tech. Government stability means less boom-bust cycle. And the quality of life — if you like museums, food, and actual seasons — is underrated.

### DC's Disadvantages

The startup scene is still too small. Big Tech presence is growing but nowhere near Austin or Seattle levels. And the cultural reputation of DC as a "government town" makes it harder to attract the builders who want to feel like they're in a tech hub.

### The Remote Wrinkle

Here's the thing: DC companies are competing for talent that doesn't need to live in DC. That means your compensation, culture, and mission better be compelling enough to win against companies in lower-cost-of-living cities offering the same salary.

### What Needs to Happen

DC needs to stop trying to be the next Silicon Valley and start being the best version of itself. Lean into the strengths — govtech, cybersecurity, policy-adjacent AI — and build a talent brand around those. Stop apologizing for being a government town. Own it.
