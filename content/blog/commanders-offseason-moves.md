## The Big Picture

Washington's front office has been busy. Like, suspiciously busy. The kind of busy that either means they have a master plan or they're throwing darts at a board covered in free agent headshots.

Let's break it down.

### What They've Done Right

The offensive line investments are paying dividends. You can't win in the NFC East without keeping your quarterback upright, and the Commanders finally seem to understand that. The draft capital they've spent on trenches over the past two years is starting to look prescient.

### What's Still Missing

The secondary is a problem. It was a problem last year, it was a problem the year before, and unless they address it aggressively, it'll be a problem again. You can't scheme your way out of getting torched by elite receivers week after week.

### The Verdict

This offseason is a B+ so far. Not perfect, but it shows direction. It shows intent. And in Washington, where dysfunction has been the brand for decades, intent is worth something.

Stay tuned. This is going to be an interesting ride.
