## The Hidden Success Story

Everyone loves to dunk on DC United. Fair enough — the results haven't been there. But if you're only looking at the first team, you're missing the most important story at the club.

### The Academy Numbers

Multiple academy products have signed professional contracts in the last two years. Two are already getting first-team minutes. One just got his first national team call-up. The pipeline is real.

### Why It Matters

Homegrown players are the economic engine of MLS. They don't count against the salary cap the same way, they have emotional ties to the club, and they develop in your system. DC United's investment in youth is the smartest thing the organization has done in years.

### The DMV Talent Pool

The DC metro area is a soccer hotbed. Between the immigrant communities, the club soccer infrastructure, and the proximity to elite competition, this region produces more raw talent than almost anywhere in the country. DC United is finally tapping into that.

### The Challenge

Keeping them. When European clubs come calling with bigger money and bigger stages, retaining homegrown talent becomes a fight. The club needs to create a pathway to first-team minutes, or these kids will leave.
