## Midseason Report Cards

The All-Star break is the natural checkpoint. For a rebuilding team, wins and losses matter less than individual development. So let's evaluate what matters.

### The Keepers

Two or three guys on this roster have shown legitimate NBA starter potential. The flashes are real — the consistency isn't there yet, but that's expected for players under 23. The important thing is the trajectory is upward.

### The Question Marks

A couple of last year's key acquisitions have been underwhelming. Not bad enough to give up on, but not good enough to build around. The next 40 games are critical for their futures in Washington.

### The Roster Cloggers

Every rebuilding team has them — the veterans who aren't good enough to help you win but take minutes from guys who need development reps. Time to make some moves.

### Overall Grade: C+

Not failing, but needs improvement. The talent is there on paper. The development has to catch up.
