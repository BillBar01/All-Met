excerpt: "The District has the talent, the capital, and the infrastructure. So why does its tech scene still feel like it's running on government contractor energy?"

## The Problem

Washington, DC has everything a thriving tech ecosystem needs: world-class universities, massive capital flows, a deep talent pool, and infrastructure that most cities would kill for. And yet, the tech scene here still feels... cautious.

Too many startups in this town are just government contractors wearing hoodies. That's not innovation. That's cosplay.

### Where DC Excels

Cybersecurity. GovTech. Policy-adjacent AI. These are legitimate strengths, and there's nothing wrong with leaning into them. The proximity to federal agencies creates opportunities that Silicon Valley literally cannot replicate.

### Where DC Falls Short

Consumer tech. Bold bets. The kind of weird, ambitious, probably-going-to-fail ideas that define real startup culture. The risk tolerance here is still too low, and it shows.

> "Move fast and break things" doesn't translate well when your biggest client is a three-letter agency.

### What Needs to Change

1. **More founder-friendly capital** — The VC scene here is growing but still too conservative
2. **Better community infrastructure** — Meetups and co-working spaces are fine, but we need real accelerators with teeth
3. **A culture shift** — Stop optimizing for the safe bet. Start building things that matter

### The Silver Lining

The talent pipeline is undeniable. Georgetown, GW, Howard, UMD — these schools are producing builders. The question is whether DC can give them a reason to stay instead of heading to Austin, Miami, or the Bay.

The potential is here. It's time to stop playing it safe.
