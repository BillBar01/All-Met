## The Numbers Don't Lie

Save percentage, goals against, high-danger save rate — pick your metric. The Capitals' goaltending has been below average this season. For a team with playoff aspirations, that's not just a concern. It's an emergency.

### The Starter Situation

The current tandem isn't getting it done. Neither goalie has seized the job, and the constant rotation is hurting both guys. You need a clear number one, and right now Washington doesn't have one.

### Deadline Options

There are netminders available. The price won't be cheap for a legitimate starter, but if the front office is serious about competing, this is the position to upgrade. A first-round pick for a proven playoff goalie isn't overpaying — it's investing.

### What If They Don't Act?

Then this team is a first-round exit at best. You can't win in the NHL playoffs without goaltending. It's that simple. The skaters are doing their part. It's time for management to do theirs.
