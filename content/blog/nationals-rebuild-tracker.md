## The State of the Farm

Look, rebuilds take time. Everyone knows that. But there's a difference between "strategic patience" and "wandering in the desert." Let's figure out which one the Nationals are doing.

### The Prospects Worth Watching

The pitching pipeline is legitimately exciting. There are arms in the upper minors that could contribute at the major league level this season. The development staff deserves credit for that — they've been consistent in their approach and it's bearing fruit.
