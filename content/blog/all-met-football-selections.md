## The All-Met Selections Are In

Every year, we recognize the best high school football talent in the DC metropolitan area. This year's class is deep, physical, and headed to some of the biggest programs in the country.

### Offensive Player of the Year

The decision wasn't close. When you throw for 3,200 yards and 38 touchdowns while leading your team to a state championship, you earn the top spot. This kid is the real deal, and the college recruiters know it.

### Defensive Player of the Year

A defensive end who changed games without the ball ever coming near him. Double teams didn't work. Triple teams barely slowed him down. He's a future first-round NFL draft pick, and he's only 17.

### The First Team

We selected 24 players across offense and defense. Every one of them earned it on the field — no politics, no legacy picks, no favors. Just production.

### What It Means

The DMV continues to be one of the best high school football regions in the country. The talent pipeline from this area to D1 programs is a pipeline — it's a highway. And this year's class is driving fast.
