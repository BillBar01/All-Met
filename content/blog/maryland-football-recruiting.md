## Keeping Talent Home

For decades, the best football players in the DMV left for programs in the SEC, Big Ten, and ACC. Maryland watched its own backyard get raided year after year. That's changing.

### The Local Pipeline

The Terps' coaching staff has made DMV recruitment their top priority. The results? Three of the top five players from the DC metro area signed with Maryland in the last cycle. That's unprecedented.

### Why It's Working

Proximity matters. Parents can watch games. High school coaches maintain relationships. The players stay connected to their communities. And Maryland is selling something real: play in the Big Ten, stay close to home, and build something.

### The On-Field Impact

Last season's roster featured more DMV products than any Maryland team in recent memory. The talent gap with the conference elite is closing. Not closed — closing. But the trajectory is clear.

### The Competition

Virginia, Penn State, and Ohio State still recruit the DMV hard. Maryland won't win every battle. But winning more than they lose? That's the new baseline. And right now, they're meeting it.
